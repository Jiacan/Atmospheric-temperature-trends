# CMIP6 Hackathon -- Atmospheric temperature trends

### Scientific motivation
it has been widely reported that the CMIP6 models have much higher climate sensitivity that the CMIP5 models. going beyond global mean surface temperature, it would be interesting to document the entire vertical structure of temperature changes caused by increasing CO2, notably polar amplification, the warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the cooling of the stratosphere. one would like, for instance, to answer the following questions: since CMIP6 models have larger climate sensitivity, do they also have a larger polar amplification than the CMIP5 models? does the stratosphere cool more in the CMIP6 than in the CMIP5 models?
